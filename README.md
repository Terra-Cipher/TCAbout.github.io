# The TerraCipher Project

The TerraCipher project aims to build integrated software solutions that turn knowledge into action. The focus on creating end-points that leverage of latent data while creating innovative dashboards enables data to become knowledge and users to take action.

The software solutions leverage heavily off tools that allow integration and they build on containerised solutions that can deliver applications through a series of micro-services.

Project teams focus on analytics solutions to create knowledge and design solutions to engage action.
